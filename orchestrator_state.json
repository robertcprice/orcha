Conduct a detailed feature engineering review for the Microstructure Model to identify any gaps or improvements. Ensure features like top-of-book, volume delta, trade imbalance, microprice, and spread are correctly utilized and explore additional features that could enhance model performance.\n3. Investigate the training pipeline for the Microstructure Model, specifically the data preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation steps, to ensure the model is trained on high-quality, representative data.\n4. Plan a series of experiments to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. Use a systematic approach like grid search or Bayesian optimization to explore different configurations.\n5. Ensure the sanity checks and data reprocessing scripts are integrated into the Microstructure Model's data pipeline. This will maintain the high data quality established in the preliminary phase.\n6. Begin preliminary development on the Mesoscale and Macroscale models in parallel. This includes setting up data pipelines, initial model architecture design, and exploratory data analysis to understand feature importance.\n",
